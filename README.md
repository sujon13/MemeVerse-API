# MemeVerse-API
This is backend for Memeverse project. 
I have used *typeScript* to write REST api. 
I have used *mongoDb* as database.

## How to run locally ##
0) Assumed you have `nodejs`, `typeScript` installed in your local environment (If not please install them first)
1) Clone this repo.
2) Run `npm install` command.
3) You need to add `.env` file in the root directory where `package.json` and then you need to copy the contents(will be shared in mail) in this `.env` file.
4) You need to set up a mongodb database locally. (Please see details step from the internet)
5) Then type `npm start` to run this project and it will be run in `3010` port.
